## Navigation and game story

You can use teh arrow keys or your mouse to walk around in thew world of "Kråkslottet". It´s a world thats include a garden, where the game starts. In the garden you can find some mushrooms, they hold on diffrent points. You can save them or eat them all at once.

To enter "The house of Kråkslottet" you walk thru the door that points at you when the game starts, you will enter a room thats tells you what your mission is. 
All those mission text are temporarty in Swedish.

You can win points by solve the missions but there are also traps and enemys to take your points. When you finished all of the rooms, you will come back to the grden and can from here walk thru the house again. From now on your points start to tick down, if you end up at 0 points the game will be over..

Good luck!
